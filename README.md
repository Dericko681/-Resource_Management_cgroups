# Resource_Management_cgroups
**Goal:** Use `cgroups` to manage system resources for Docker containers under stress.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a Docker container that simulates heavy CPU and memory usage.
2. Configure `cgroups` to:
    - Limit CPU usage to 25% for the container.
    - Restrict memory usage to 512MB.
3. Test the setup by running a resource-intensive script in the container.
4. Use tools like `htop` and `vmstat` to monitor resource consumption.
5. Log and summarize the performance in a report.
